    In this experiment, we will present different images to each of your eyes.

    When this happens, your brain has to resolve the conflict between the two
    competing images. This is called "binocular rivalry."
    '''
    _show_instructions(win, kb, msg)

    msg = '''
    The brain usually resolves this conflict by "supressing" one of the images,
    letting the other image be the "dominant" image for a while.

    It will look like one image (the dominant one) is covering the other.
    '''
    _show_instructions(win, kb, msg)

    msg = '''
    But which image is dominant switches regularly. We are interested in how
    often your brain switches between images and whether we can predict
    the time of these perceptual switches from your heart rate.
    '''

    msg = '''
    You will view two such rival images (red and blue bars) for 20 minutes.
    Each time the dominant image switches, please let us know by pressing a button.

    Please press the LEFT arrow key when the RED image is newly dominant,
    and the RIGHT arrow key when the BLUE image is dominant.

    Sometimes you will see a mixture between both images. This is expected.

    On each trial of the next task, you will see two pulsating circles on the screen.

    You will see the circles side-by-side for 10 seconds,

    Please do not 'cheat' by feeling your pulse with your hand.
